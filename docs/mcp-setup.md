# MCP setup and exercise checklist

This repo already includes a working example for connecting an MCP server for GitHub Copilot.

## What I added in this branch

- `docs/mcp-setup.md` — this file (you are reading it).

## Current repo status

- `.vscode/mcp.json` — present and contains the example GitHub Copilot MCP server configuration.

## Checklist (exercise steps)

- [x] Verify `.vscode/mcp.json` exists in the repository
- [ ] Confirm Agent mode and authenticate the MCP server in a Codespace (manual)
- [ ] Verify Copilot shows the MCP tools (manual)
- [ ] Mark the exercise as complete in Issue #1 (once the above are done)

## Notes

If you want me to push the exact `mcp.json` to `main` directly instead of a PR, tell me and I can open a small PR that targets `main` instead.
